## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is one of the CCM1/ACM1 practical assignments during my MPhil Scientific Computing course at the University of Cambridge. It marks my progress learning C++ and other tools in the developer suite.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Simply clone the repo and put it somewhere in your computer. Things are portable.

### Prerequisites

C++ compiler and Make software are required but they are shipped by default in most of the OS out there. The only thing special is `gnuplot` if one wants to use the codes to the fullest extent.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

I will type the following on my machine under the repo directory:

````
make && ./bin/slic_solver_2d && ./gif_plot.gp
````
